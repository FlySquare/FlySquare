### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I was born in 2002 in Yalova/TURKEY. I have been continuing the adventure that I started with Php and Mysql at the age of 14 for 5 years. I am actively developing myself and doing various projects on React, React Native, Laravel, Php, Sql, MongoDB, Javascript, Node.JS. In these 5 years, I have developed myself using languages â€‹â€‹such as Java (native android), arduino, Python, C and C # for more than 6 months, and have mastered the algorithm and syntax details in various projects.
